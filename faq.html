        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <main>
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>Q: Are the items you sell new?</h2>
            <p>A: The items we sell are brand new and unused official releases supplied to us by record companies, unless stated otherwise in the listing.  Generally all items are sealed (this will be stated in the listing title).  Occasionally we may open an LP to confirm any colour variant. We sometimes sell used items, this will be shown in the listing.
            </p>

            <h2>Q: Are the items you sell in stock?</h2>
            <p>A: Most of the items we sell are in stock in Melbourne, Australia and are typically despatched within 24 hours (working days only, excludes public holidays).

                <br>Occasionally we may offer pre-order titles and the estimated date when these will be in stock is shown in the listing.
                
                <br>We may change the handling time for operational reasons at any time (as such all items may not be despatched within 24 hours).</p>

            <h2>Q: How much is postage?</h2>
            <p>A: Unless otherwise stated postage to any Australian address is FREE for Australia Post's standard eParcel service, and this service includes online tracking. We also offer express shipping for a nominal charge - please note this does NOT guarantee next day delivery and delivery to certain regional/remote locations can take longer. Postage to non-Australian/overseas addresses is shown in the listing, please select your country to view the rates.</p>

            <h2>Q: I'm looking for a specific pressing - country, colour, cover, condition, release date, or other characteristics - is that what you are selling?</h2>
            <p>A: CONTACT US BEFORE PURCHASE - so we can check to ensure we have what you are looking for. Our products are sourced from Australia, USA, Europe, UK and elsewhere; unless otherwise stated the product may have come from any of these countries. Condition; unless otherwise noted our stock is brand new and generally sealed. Brand new product can occasionally show slight signs of handling. If you are seeking "mint" condition copies please contact us first so we can verify this for you. Picture discs - please note; due to their manufacturing process picture discs generally have poorer sound reproduction and can sometimes be warped.</p>

            <h2>Q: How can I pay for my order?</h2>
            <p>A: We accept payments by credit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), Paypal, direct bank transfer, Afterpay and Zippay.</p>

            <h2>Q: What postage options do you have?</h2>
            <p>A: Within Australia all LPs and box sets are sent by Australia Post eParcel, this service is fully trackable (certain lower value items like CDs and 7"s records may not be sent with tracking).  We also offer express post, this option is available in the checkout.  Please note if you want your order sent by express post and buy more than 1 item you must choose express post for all items. 

                <br>All overseas orders are sent tracked and this tracking is usually visible on your local country's postal service's website around a week after despatch.</p>

            <h2>Q: Can I pick up my order?</h2>
            <p>A: YES:  We are open Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm, closed public holidays..</p>

            <h2>Q: Do you use any special packaging to send LPs, 7"s and box sets?</h2>
            <p>A: We have our own custom designed LP mailers and these provide the highest level of protection during shipping.  We also place your LP in a plastic sleeve prior to packing to further protect it.  In addition we have our own custom designed 7" mailers and will send box sets and large orders in larger boxes with extra packing.

                <br>We also have a double box option which you can choose if you wish to purchase additional protection for your LP.</p>

            <h2>Q: What does MOV mean in your listings?</h2>
            <p>A: MOV stands for Music On Vinyl, a reissues and new issue vinyl label. Please note MOV titles generally come in resealable sleeves, all are brand new and unplayed. We may remove the LPs from jacket/sleeves to prevent seam splits.</p>

            <h2>Q: What are the download codes that are included (if any are stated)?</h2>
            <p>A: PLEASE NOTE: if we are advised by suppliers that download codes are included with an LP or box set we will state this in the listing, however on occasions download codes are not provided or may be provided but may not work in Australia or in your country (if different). We are not responsible for supplying a working download code in the event one is missing or is included but does not work in your territory. We will do our best to make good in such circumstances but can not guarantee any useable card will be supplied.</p>

            <h2>Q: If there's a problem with my order when I receive it what can I do?</h2>
            <p>A: Please contact us as we are committed to your 100% satisfaction and will resolve any issue you may have.</p>
