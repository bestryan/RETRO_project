# RETRO_project
online store &amp; forums website

This project was developed through a business case study, the site has the following features:
*online shopping
*forum
*photo gallery
*fully responsive

It is coded with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please run your local server using MAMP or XAMPP.

Instruction: First create two databases named "Retro_forum" and "Retro_store". Then import sample data from the folder to each database.

If you name a different database, you will need some changes in the PHP code to be able to execute.

After that, you can go straight to the Retro_project folder where can you explore the sites.

If you have any questions or issues, please let me know I would be happy to help. 

Happy Coding
