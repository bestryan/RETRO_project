# RETRO_project

This project Retro Records is developed by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL database. The aim is to replace the current outdated site with new features and promote their business.

This project was developed through a business case study, the site has the following features:
*** A functioning shopping cart that allows users to fill a shopping cart and stores the checkout details of the shopper in the database.
*** A functioning multi-category forum with a database connection to store previous topics and posts.
*** OOP PHP is used in the site
*** Fully responsive test on desktop, medium size screen and mobile device

It is coded with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please run your local server using MAMP or XAMPP.

To fully function in this project, the server-side database must be installed and set up correctly. We recommend using PHPMyAdmin to set up the database using MySQL DBMS.

Instruction: First create two databases named "Retro_forum" and "Retro_store". Then import sample data from the folder to each database.

If you name a different database, you will need some changes in the PHP code to be able to execute.

After that upload the Retro_project folder to the server. If you are using XAMPP or MAMP, copy the folder to the htdoc directory.

Run the server and the index.html should run automatically in the browser.

If you have any questions or issues, please let me know I would be happy to help. 

Happy Coding
